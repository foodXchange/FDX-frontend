# TypeScript Migration Summary

## Overview
This project has been fully migrated to TypeScript to improve type safety and maintainability.

## Changes Made

### 1. Converted Files
- `server.js` → `server.ts`
- `build-for-deploy.js` → `build-for-deploy.ts`
- Created `scripts/cleanup-old-files.ts` for maintenance

### 2. Configuration
- Added `tsconfig.node.json` for Node.js scripts
- Updated `package.json` with TypeScript scripts:
  - `server`: Run development server with ts-node
  - `server:prod`: Run production server
  - `build:server`: Compile server TypeScript
  - `build:deploy`: Run deployment build script
  - `cleanup:old-files`: Clean up old JS files

### 3. Dependencies Added
- `@types/express`: Type definitions for Express
- `ts-node`: TypeScript execution for Node.js

### 4. Files Retained as JavaScript
- `craco.config.js` - Must remain JS as CRACO doesn't support TS config files

### 5. Cleaned Up Files
All old utility and fix scripts have been removed to maintain a clean codebase.

## Usage

### Development Server
```bash
npm run server
```

### Build for Deployment
```bash
npm run build:deploy
```

### Production Server
```bash
npm run build:server
npm run server:prod
```

## Benefits
1. **Type Safety**: All server and build scripts now have full TypeScript type checking
2. **Better IDE Support**: Enhanced autocomplete and error detection
3. **Consistency**: Entire codebase now uses TypeScript
4. **Maintainability**: Easier to refactor and extend with type information

## Notes
- The React app source code was already in TypeScript
- All new scripts should be written in TypeScript
- Use `tsconfig.node.json` for Node.js scripts outside the React app
